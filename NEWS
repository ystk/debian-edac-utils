Version 0.18 (2011-11-09);
- Do not print "No errors to report" with edac-util --quiet
- Add DIMM labels for Intel S2600JF and Supermicro H8QG6

Version 0.17 (2010-02-10);
- Fix memory leaks in libedac and edac-util(1).

Version 0.16.1 (2009-01-30);
 - Fix libedac.so library version, which should not have gone
    backwards.

Version 0.16 (20080-12-31);
 - Fix out-of-tree builds of edac-utils.
 - Support up to 6 channels with edac-utils and libedac. Applications
    directly linked to libedac will need to be recompiled to take advantage
    of this change.
 - Add DIMM labels for ASUSTeK Computer INC. M3A32-MVP DELUXE.

version 0.15 (2008-09-22):
 - DIMM label information may now be stored in separate files
   under a labels.d directory (e.g. /etc/edac/labels.d/*), in addition
   to the labels.db file.
 - Preferentially read mainboard information from sysfs if available.
 - Don't parse dmidecode "System information" section, use 
   "Board Information" instead.

version 0.14 (2008-05-30):
 - Fix typos in edac-util(1) man page.
 - Remove any extra newlines on EDAC DIMM labels.
 - Add Supermicro H8DA3-2 DIMM labels to label db.

version 0.13 (2008-02-26):
 - Abandon use of udev rules to load EDAC DIMM labels. Most often
   the udev rules were called too early in boot to be effective.
 - Reinstate load of DIMM labels in EDAC init script.

version 0.12 (2008-02-08):
 - The edac-ctl script is no longer responsible for the load and unload
   of EDAC drivers. The drivers will automatically be loaded in most
   current distributions. 
 - The "edac" init script no longer does anything unless EDAC_DRIVER
   is set in /etc/sysconfig/edac (or equivalent). Set EDAC_DRIVER to the
   driver name to load if drivers aren't being automatically loaded.
 - DIMM labels are now automatically registered at driver load time
   through a udev rule installed by edac-utils.

version 0.11 (2007-11-06):
 - Fix for edac-ctl parsing of 'lspci -n' output in lspci 2.2.3.
 - Add labels for Dell PowerEdge 1850 and AsusTek A85NX, A8N-E, and KFN5-D SLI.
 - Removed debian directory from repository
	
version 0.10 (2007-06-29):
 - Allow for whitespace in motherboard vendor and model name in labels.db.
 - Allow for empty DIMM labels in edac-ctl --print-labels.
 - Properly substitute ./configure parameters (e.g. sysconfdir)
   in final edac.init (init script) and edac-ctl scripts.
 - Find locations of utilities used by edac-ctl at runtime.

version 0.9 (2007-05-08):
 - Add manpages for edac-util(1), edac-ctl(8), and edac(3). 

version 0.8 (2007-04-25):
 - Issue edac-util "No errors to report" message to stdout not stderr.

version 0.7 (2007-04-18):
 - Change default output of edac-util to better identify any failing DIMM(s).
    Previous default output can be obtained with --report=simple.
 - Fix edac-util --report=full output to include error counts not associated
    with a DIMM (so-called "noinfo" error counts).
 - Update Supermicro H8QM8 labels.
 - edac-ctl --print-labels now shows registered labels (in sysfs) alongside 
    configured labels (from labels.db).

version 0.6 (2007-03-15):
 - Add Supermicro H8QM8 to distributed DIMM labels database.
 - Don't warn about sysfs files that don't exist when registering DIMM labels.
   This is probably just unpopulated memory banks on motherboard.
	
version 0.5 (2006-10-13):
 - Add Supermicro H8DCE to distributed DIMM labels database.
 - Fix labels.db parsing to allow single <mc.row.chan> after each DIMM label.
 - Allow edac-ctl --mainboard= to accept "vendor model" as well as 
   "vendor:model" when explicitly specifying mainboard information.

Version 0.4 (2006-05-10):
 - Allow motherboard vendor string to have whitespace.
 - Fix dmidecode parsing to strip whitespace from end of strings.
 - Add Tyan S2895 motherboard DIMM labels to labels database.
 - Support for sysfsutils-2.0.0.
 - Fix edac-util -r to allow optional argument.

Version 0.3 (2006-03-21):
 - Fix permissions in specfile.
 - Omit warnings when reads fail from EDAC sysfs files.
 - Fix possible hang in edac-ctl when registering dimm labels.
  

Version 0.2 (2006-03-16):
 - Fixed edac-ctl bug in --register-labels.
 - Print error in edac-util --report if no memory controllers are found.

Version 0.1 (2006-03-14):
 - Initial release.
