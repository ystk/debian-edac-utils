.TH EDAC-UTIL 1 "@META_DATE@" "@META_ALIAS@" "EDAC error reporting utility"

.SH NAME
edac-util \- EDAC error reporting utility.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edac-util 
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBedac-util\fR program reads information from EDAC (Error 
Detection and Correction) drivers in the kernel,
using files exported by these drivers in sysfs. With
no options, \fBedac-util\fR will report any uncorrected error
(UE) or corrected error (CE) information recorded 
by EDAC, along with any DIMM label information registered with EDAC.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-h, --help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "-q, --quiet"
Quiet mode. For some reports, \fBedac-util\fR will report corrected
and uncorrected error counts for all MC, csrow, and channel combinations,
even if the current count of errors is zero. The \fI\-\-quiet\fR
flag will suppress the display of any locations with zero errors, 
thus creating a more terse report. No output will be generated if
there are zero total errors currently recorded by EDAC. Additionally,
the use of \fI\-\-quiet\fR will suppress all informational and debug
messages, displaying only fatal errors.
.TP
.BI "-v, --verbose"
Increase verbosity. Multiple \fI\-v\fR\'s may be used.
.TP
.BI "-s, --status"
Displays the current status of EDAC drivers. \fBedac-util\fR will
report whether it detects that EDAC drivers are loaded, and the
number of memory controllers (MCs) found in sysfs. In verbose mode,
the MC id and name of each controller will also be printed.
.TP
.BI "-r, --report=" report,...
Specify the report to generate. Currently, the available reports
are \fIdefault\fR, \fIsimple\fR, \fIfull\fR, \fIue\fR, and \fIce\fR.
These reports are detailed in the \fBEDAC REPORTS\fR section
below. More than one report may be specified in a comma-separated
list.

.SH EDAC REPORTS
.TP
.B default
The \fIdefault\fR \fBedac-util\fR report is generated when the program is
run without any options. If there are no errors logged by EDAC, 
this report will display "No errors to report." to stdout. Otherwise,
error counts for each MC, csrow, channel combination with attributed
errors are displayed, along with corresponding DIMM labels, if these
labels have been registered in sysfs. 

The default report will also
display any errors that do not have any DIMM information. These
errors occur when errors are reported in the memory controller
overflow register, indicating that more than one error
occurred during a given EDAC poll cycle. It is usually obvious
from which DIMM locations these errors were generated.
.TP
.B simple
The \fIsimple\fR report reports total corrected and uncorrected errors
for each MC detected on the system. It also displays a tally of 
total errors. With the \fI\-\-quiet\fR option, only non-zero error
counts are displayed.
.TP
.B full
The \fIfull\fR report generates a line of output for every
MC, csrow, channel combination found in EDAC sysfs. This includes
counts of errors with no information ("noinfo" errors). Output
is of the form:
.nf

MC:(csrow|noinfo):(label|all):(UE|CE):count 

.fi
With the \fI\-\-quiet\fR option, only non-zero error counts will
be displayed.
.TP
.B ue
This report simply displays the total number of Uncorrected Errors
(UEs) detected on the system.
With the \fI\-\-quiet\fR option, output will be suppressed unless
there are 1 or more errors to report.
.TP
.B ce
This report simply displays the total number of Corrected Errors
(CEs) detected on the system.
With the \fI\-\-quiet\fR option, output will be suppressed unless
there are 1 or more errors to report.
