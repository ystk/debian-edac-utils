Description: report kernel-detected PCI and ECC RAM errors
 This package contains the user-space utilities for use with the EDAC
 kernel subsystem.  EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) is a set of
 Linux kernel modules for handling hardware-related errors.  Currently
 its major focus is ECC memory error handling. However it also detects
 and reports PCI bus parity errors.
 .
 PCI parity errors are supported on all architectures (and are a
 mandatory part of the PCI specification).
 .
 Main memory ECC drivers are memory controller specific.  At the time
 of writing, drivers exist for many x86-specific chipsets and CPUs,
 and some PowerPC, and MIPS systems.
 .
 This package provides command lines tools
